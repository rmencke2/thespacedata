## 🎯 After Running

### You'll See:

1. **Individual Results** for each test
2. **Strategy Averages** across all 5 cryptos
3. **Top Performers** (best return, Sharpe, win rate)
4. **Strategy Analysis** (what each does best)
5. **Overall Winner** (composite score)

### Then Decide:

**If Momentum wins:**
→ Best for bull markets, catching pumps
→ Paper trade on BTC or ETH
→ Needs active monitoring

**If Flash Crash wins:**
→ Best for volatile markets
→ Buy the dips strategy
→ Less frequent trades

**If neither beats stocks:**
→ Maybe crypto isn't for you
→ Or try different timeframe (4H instead of daily)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### These Strategies Are:
✅ **Crypto-specific** (not adapted stock strategies)
✅ **Built for volatility** (wider stops, bigger targets)
✅ **Event-driven** (momentum spikes, panic sells)
✅ **Tested on 3 years** (bull + bear markets)

### They Are NOT:
❌ Holy grails (no strategy always wins)
❌ Risk-free (crypto drawdowns are 20-35%)
❌ Set-and-forget (need monitoring)
❌ Guaranteed (past ≠ future)
