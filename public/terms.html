        <p>Welcome to Influzer.ai, operated by Influzer ("we," "our," or "us"). By accessing or using our website, online tools, applications, or services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using our Services. If you are using our Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization.</p>

        <p>These Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy, which governs how we handle your data and what conduct is permitted while using the Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Use of Services</h2>
        <p>We provide AI-powered tools for logo generation, favicon creation, and various design utilities. Most features are available without sign-up or registration. Some advanced tools and models are available under a paid subscription or credit-based system.</p>
        <p>You must use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Content & Permissions</h2>
        <p>By using our Services, you may upload or generate data such as images, text, or files ("Your Content"). You retain full ownership of Your Content. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over it.</p>
        <p>You grant us a limited license to host, process, and transmit Your Content as necessary to provide the Services. We may also allow trusted third-party providers to process Your Content on our behalf (e.g., cloud storage or AI inference APIs), solely for service functionality.</p>
        <p>We do not use Your Content for training AI models and all user-uploaded or generated files are automatically deleted from our servers every 6 hours.</p>

        <h2>3. Prohibited Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Services or violate any applicable laws. In particular, you must not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upload, generate, or attempt to create NSFW, explicit, violent, or illegal content.</li>
          <li>Probe, scan, or test system vulnerabilities.</li>
          <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to any part of the Services or related systems.</li>
          <li>Use automated tools to create accounts or abuse Services (e.g., bots, crawlers).</li>
          <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the Services or software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Violation of these rules may result in immediate suspension or termination of your access.</p>

        <h2>4. Software License</h2>
        <p>We may provide downloadable software to access or enhance our Services. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use this software solely for accessing the Services.</p>
        <p>Where applicable, certain components may be governed by open-source licenses that override specific terms here. You may not reverse-engineer or attempt to extract source code unless permitted by law.</p>
